God,1,And when the waves cover them like shadows,"And when the waves cover them like shadows, they call upon God,
making their religion sincerely His.
But when he has delivered them to the land,
some of them are lukewarm.
And no one denies Our signs except every ungrateful traitor."
God,2,It was an age of ignorance,"It was an age of ignorance,
Ignorance of the unity of Allah,
Ignorance of shame,
Ignorance of peace,
Ignorance of the worth of women. Then Jibrail comes to Mohammed With the message from Allah,
And says, “In the name of Allah, read” (Iqra). And ignorance is dispelled.
The light of Islam shines
And envelops the world."
God,3,It is commonly said that life begins at birth,"It is commonly said that life begins at birth.
Actually, it has begun eons ago.
It is coming together in you today
By the spinning of the spheres,
By the light of the stars,
And we are given a chance to choose.
Should we fritter away this precious time?
Do we waste it in meaningless activity?
Or do we count the hours, the minutes and seconds in prayer? If there is hope in heaven,
If there is horror in hell,
The choice is easy."
God,4,Heavens has umpteen meanings,"Heavens has umpteen meanings
It is here on earth
It is in the person of Imam or Dai
It is at the feet of a mother
It is close, it is far,
For a Mumin, it is a pass
But O my brothers and sisters in faith, Do you want to be a slave or a master there? Do good here and you will be a master. Do bad and you will be a slave.
The choice is yours.
But Heaven is waiting for you."
God,5,Calm depths,"Calm depths
In fathoms,
Fathoms of blue
Like an underground stream,
Clean, crystal-clear, cool.
Or as the swaying silences
Deep peace of the setting sun
As the beam,
light shot from fresh wet leaves,
Green in their health,
Spectators watch in awe,
Wonder at the miracle of life,
Of knowledge, of love, of tenderness of strength Who is He?
Can we open our eyes at the brilliance?
Only as He takes us deep down in His gaze, His mercy, His bounty
Not love for another,
For He has made us His own.

God,6,A boulder hurtling down the slope,"A boulder hurtling down the slope,
Crushing tender juicy saplings
Trampling cruelly small, small blue flowers
Innocent small, blue in scents,
Below lies a village, with human interest, human joys, human tears,
But I have no hope, except a screeching will to stop it, From reaching its tragic destination
And forever his the eternal infinite how?
How? Why?
Perhaps the ground gave way under its weight Perhaps, O perhaps, vines did not grow
Chaining it to the mountaintop
Perhaps it deliberately wrenched its gaze
Away from the fleecy cloud just above it,
That shattered the peak from scrutiny
From understanding, from closeness,
O God of the clouds,
Save it from destruction,
Halt its headlong passage,
By your mercy,
Which reaches to the deep mires of evil."
God,7,Where does it come from?,"Where does it come from? The Mouth? The Source? OR ….? Is it flowing from His open arms?
It is?
For men shall continue to sorrow,
For men shall continue to die,
For men shall ………… watching the birds fly,
Watching the rainbow disappear,
Where or how?
And the rain falls to caress the seedling,
Lying below the ground,
Hinding their secret, parched hunger.
As Time flows, so it will flow on.
Unending, even though men close their hearts and eyes, and turn their backs,
It will seep through their smell, their sound, and make them wont with ache and pain
(14th July 1963)"
God,8,I would miss him,"I would miss him
As the earth misses the sun
When night is overcast,
Or as the trees feel bare,
Without the habitation of the bird that sing,
For all that is beautiful truthful
Is associates associated with you, my Lord
The surge for life, confidence,
The surer step, stable in intelligence,
To make the world look green, green and deep
Fresh from cooling falling rains
The sun shining on the dew laden flowers
Heavy with mercy overcome
Urging them to fly upwards with the joy of embrace, Or even to bring a smile to lips,
To find this mighty, perplexing, wrinkled,
Creation for joy and exuberance
Is wrought by you, My Lord,
As sure as the creation of your artistic hands.
The earth may spin itself to a living meteor
But you will take my love,
Flowing through my life blood,
Absorb me in your immortal person,
Living in love
Till I cease to think
And am born into you.

The gold, the real, the truth.
I do not possess the eye of a jeweler,
or the skill of a professional,
or the wisdom of saps a sage
And He says do not look far,
Do not look for the dazzle
Do not look for the truth
“Look for ME”
In silence our voices hush,
Our eyes rove the horizon,
Our heart says “Allah”"
God,10,The extravagant painter,"The extravagant painter
Ever the same and eternally vivid
Painting the horizon with bloody scarlet, orange, yellow The landscape with soothing green of every hue Lighting the monotony
With dainty flowers
And men’s minds with highest sentiments
Where he the ideals of eternal, worth of ideals of eternity Whose touch leaves to dullness, the purification of beauty Whose truth is beauty
Whose light is beauty
Whose love, creation and compassion knows no comparison The black trees at night reach up to the sky
Sins Sing and wave praises in the morning light
The waste land stretches far away
Yet here and there the fruitfulness of indescribable loveliness He holds the universe in the palm of his hand
Yet has the tenderness to reach the innermost recesses of the human soul.

will the seed burst forth into a tree,

As for souls desolate wasteful, wretched

Let me not drown in the mud of mindlessness, thinking nothing but food, dress and the like Inspire me, O Allah
O Allah, inspire me to write to write to write
Inspire me to lose myself in thoughts of you,
So that worldly occasion affects surface staystrings albeit painful but passing
What remains always forever is thoughts of you, O Allah Compelling me to put this on paper
For them is the balm, therein is the medicine
Therein is the cure, therein is the health.
If you give me this, all else is unimportant
If you give me this, all pain is painless
If you give me this, all hopelessness becomes hope There are vistas and horizons in front far-out everywhere Fresh winds flowing blowing in no limits,
The heart bursting with thought,
The mind drowned in emotions
Enjoying every moment of life
Exhilarating in its beauty and miracle You are the giver of life Give me the vision of hope
Coloring nature with rosy hues
Changing the gloom into piercing rays of expectation Do I ask too much, is it too much to demand,
I know I have sinned,
I am drowned in sin,
Sinned so, I have not the right to raise my head nor ask you But you have given me life,
Now I ask you to give me your gift of khidmat
Without which life is meaningless, dark, sad, without joy Let me not meet the end with no credit, only tears
Let me not meet the end with no service performed, only vacuum
Allah is all knowing, just, merciful, and omnipotent O Allah, temper justice with mercy
Forgive me my sins, overlook my faults
My ignorance is over whelming,
My knowledge puny,
O Allah, You who are omnipotent and merciful
Give me knowledge that I may recognize
Give me will, to act accordingly
Give me faith, to love unfailingly
Give me a heart, that beats the buffeting of storms Which would seemingly burst,
How does it survive, how does it pass through
It is a miracle or yet another punishment."

God,22,"One tree went, another came","One tree went, another came. When the second tree withered the third tree, when it has exhausted its age, the fourth tree bloomed to give the sweet fragrance of remembrance of the third. When the fourth tree was passing away the fifth was ready to take its place. When the fifth was ready to go, now the time had come for the blossoming of the sixth tree. Time passed and the sixth tree blossomed.
Every tree in blossoming was following the divine order and passed away only after evolution of time. It did not eternally subsist but its fragrance was ever present. The young blossoming tree served as a remembrance of the one that had passed away.
Unique are the trees, and unique their tales, passing through centuries. Who do we ask about them? Where do we search for their secret? Perhaps on some far distant shore, we shall meet someone ---? Or on the lonely heights of some mountain.
Or is it not somebody hiding his secret in some deserted garden of palm far from the crowded city.
Whom shall we ask? Who will explain? Six trees and they centuries old? Afterall how vast is this earth and where can the secret lie?
Dear friend, do not wander afar, search for the secret in the recesses of your soul. After searching the answer from my heart again and again, I have received only one answer – surely you will discover these trees.
Are you surprised --- How is that? The heart knows that every tree is unique and when it had passed away, another tree bloomed to take its place, not only making its own the particular virtues of the deceasing plant but adding the personal quality of its own to achieve more uniqueness.
You will protest that surely, we know this, but do have patience – why do we not ask the sixth tree? How? Are you surprised!
My dear, the sixth tree has come to life after the fifth has passed away. Yes yes I see there is joy dancing in the light of your eyes. I thought that you were satisfied with the idea that the sixth tree is with us, and it can unfold the mysteries of its predecessors – let us go to it,
Wait a moment, I think that in spite of believing that the sixth tree exists, we do not know where to find it.
Think deep with complete faith in God, we will meet tomorrow."

Mohammad Rasulullah,1,"“In the name of Allah, read”","“In the name of Allah, read!”

To calm him, comfort him,

So, after the tribulations of the Meccans,
He came to Khadija
He was home."

Husain and his seventy-two have been slaughtered,

Of the House of Mohammed and Khadija.
Their very names suggest suffering and endurance beyond compare, Beyond Human capacity,
Beyond the power of the mind to think.
Numbing, paralyzing pain
But they suffered, they witnessed, they endured.
The epitome of womanhood of Karbala who suffered with their men, Who stayed hungry and thirsty with their men,
All alone in the world
Without father and mother
Without brother without husband
They live for one purpose
To serve their Mola Ali Zainul Abedin
To fulfill the wishes of their brother Husain
How could they stand
After seeing the slaughter of Husain
How could they look around and see?
Life in tatters and hope disintegrating.
Then there rise from the hot sands of Karbala two lionesses, Zainab and Umme Kulsum
Their roar brings down Yazid with his throne to the ground, And the name of Husain reverberates throughout the world."

If it is for grief, it brings sadness.

If they are Fatema’s tears for a momin, They will save him from hellfire
And an entry into Jannat and life everlasting So momin,
Cry your heart out,
Heaven awaits you."
Husain Imam,9,The Quran says,"The Quran says, “From water we have created every living thing,”

They see the pond of Kausar in the blades of swords, They see Ali standing beside the pond of Kausar, And they ride toward the enemy, smiling and joyous,
They are going home to Heaven and everlasting life with Husain
What more can they hope for, ask for, pray for? That in truth is the life‐giving water."

Mohammed sees the little Ali killed in Husain’s arms, Hasan sees his brother lying on the hot sand,
And Shimmar advancing with a blunt knife,
Karbala is written in history with torture and blood, And in our hearts with agony and pain,
But the holy five are reunited again in heaven.

Husain Imam,18,Hur is at the crossroads,"Hur is at the crossroads,
One of Yazid,
Paved with wealth and worldly victory, The other of Husain,
Paved with death and agony,
He chooses Husain,
For the wealth of heaven and ultimate victory."
Husain Imam,19,Man can endure pain,"Man can endure pain,
Not the pain of Karbala,
Man can endure thirst,
Not the thirst of Karbala,
Man can endure the death of a child,
Not the massacre of a child in his father’s arms in Karbala, Man can endure suffering,
Not the suffering of Karbala
Man can endure loss,
But not the loss of Karbala.
Yet, if you want to get rid of your pain, your thirst, your agony, your suffering, your loss,
Pervade your mind with the tragedy of Karbala, You are cleansed of all your pain, all your thirst, all your suffering, all your loss
You are washed clean."
Husain Imam,20,The horror of Karbala,"It is blisteringly hot,
Husain with his party
Of women and children,
His sons and brothers,
His loyal seventy – two,
Have reached Karbala,
Facing an army of thousands,
And then the 10th of Moharram dawns. But Allah has not created the word to describe, The horror of Karbala.
(19thJanuary 2023)"
Husain Imam,21,"Husain is journeying towards Karbala Husain is journeying towards Karbala, To pay a debt,","A debt he would pay in blood and thirst, A debt he would pay by sacrifice and agony, A debt he promised Mohammed,
A debt of thousands of years to come. The sun is scorching,
The sand is blistering,
Husain is slaughtered,
Abbas, Aliakbar, Aliasgar are slaughtered, The faithful seventy-two are killed. But the land of Karbala is blessed,
Husain and his faithful are here,
Karbala is Husain,
And Husain is Karbala.
(11th August 2022)"
Husain Imam,22,Karbala is a fusion of extremes,"Karbala is a fusion of extremes,
There is Husain,
And there is Shimar,
There are women, children and the loyal seventy – two, And there is an army of thousand,
There is supreme loyalty,
There is extreme revenge,
There is extreme thirst,
There is overflowing Furaat,
There is heaven,
There is hell,
Husain is slaughtered,
Yazid’s army is seemingly victorious,
Yet the name of Husain reverberates to the skies, And Yazid is on fire in the depths of the earth.
(10th August 2022)"
Husain Imam,23,It is late in the day of Aashura,"It is late in the day of Aashura,
The loyal seventy – two have given their lives for truth, The sons, the brother, the men of the family of Husain, Are slain and strewn,
On the hot sands of Karbala,
Husain is alone,
And fighting with the strength of Haider,
But the last debt is yet to be paid,
And Husain sheaths his swords,
For the will of Allah."

Life,1,What it is to be alone,"What it is to be alone
Alone in a crowd
Alone with loved ones,
Sitting solitary at night, with all asleep,
The trees silent, the wind silent
The birds, the people all silent.
To be alone- I like it.
To feel alone – that’s tragic.
To be given sight, then darkness without
Ears to hear with, then the silence of abandoned conclusionloneliness, The wish to give-No one to receive
To love, nothing in return
Frustration, hopelessness
A blench blank wall at every turn, days pass by - and nights, Nothing accomplished, nothing fullfilledulfilled
So much fruit unplucked, so much water unharnessed So much good intention wasted
Death will come barging in tomorrow
The question will be, what have you done,
What have you done for the time given you?
And I will bow my head in shame
No excuse. No pleading
I have done nothing, affected nothing, accomplished nothing For the grace of life,
For the gift of life
My return is bleak, shame is my reward.
Dashed intentions, is my return."

You do not have a choice,
You win either way,
Living or dying."
Life,5,How shall we thank you?,"How shall we thank you?
Do honour, reverence, homage before you,
Kneel to beg your mercy and prayers?
Since to repay you is beyond what our passing minutes will allow,
Even the treasures of your love – eludes our heart’s grasp, Your strength, power, overpowers,
Your mercy engulfs, flooding, pervading our hearts and minds. You have given us ourselves, our souls, to purify in sacrifice, Lives to illuminate in your service, happiness and joy together, Blessings of a little life enriched with your love, And those little gifts that are natural as the light and the wind, As flowing as a torrential river.
So we shall thank you,
As the world thanks the sun, the moon, the stars for making it bright.
By shining with their brilliance,
As the flowers thank the sky for bringing rain in mercy, By giving off their fragrance,
As man thanks the air for allowing him to breathe, By service to Him,
Who has given him more than breath,
More than light, more than sight,
Colour, life, purpose, destiny."

The gloom increases,
Then when the earth is most desperate,
Then there is a burst of lightening,
With accompanying thunder,

The earth is inundated with life giving rain,
Every branch, every tree, every blade of grass drinks thirstily, It is gloomy no more."

Neglecting their work,
Foregoing some difficulty

Passing as a flash before the eyes,
Acknowledging the homage of a thousands,
Adoring her at the mere quality of a name,
More peace in the soft lapping of the waves, as they run through the pebbles on the shore. Or the swarm of white as the doves bob with tranquility
Knowing yet deceiving himself
Man takes pleasure in temporary gains
When the eternity of nature is unnoticed."
Nature,3,The Sun pillowed on billowy clouds,"The sun pillowed on billowy clouds
Softly resting to sleep as night creeps on
The light plays havoc---- intense brightness
And leaves a furnace in a universe of darkness.
Amidst nature, soft breezes and waving trees
A turbulent heart keeps vigil,
Bears witness to the calm and peace
The birds swoop and soar
With gliding smoothness
Framed against a violet sky
Wooing and cooing
with infinite patience
Bit Bid farewell to the setting sun
A torn and ragged heart requires little more than a Rainbow sky,
A balmy breeze
When Where is the link between Man and heart,
That can find solace in changing time
And man eternally discontent with generous heart and noble mind
Others have suffered before me, will suffer after me
But times stands still today.
And it hurts like hell.
