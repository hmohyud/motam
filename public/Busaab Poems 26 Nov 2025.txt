Foreword
Sakina Busaheba is the embodiment of the strong Muslim woman—steadfast in faith, serene in adversity, radiant in love. She stands firm through calamity yet greets every soul with a smile. Her heart rejoices in gratitude through fire and rain. Her lips are ever moist with the name of Ali, and her heart overflows with love for Husain.
For over fifty years she was the solace—sakina—of her husband, the 53rd Dāʿī al-Muṭlaq, Syedna Khuzaima Qutbuddin (RA): his companion in light and darkness alike. After his passing, she yearns for him day and night, yet remains strong and content, knowing she will meet him again in heaven.
Sakina Busaheba’s lineage is luminous. She is the mother of the 54th and present Tayyibi Dāʿī al-Muṭlaq, Syedna Taher Fakhruddin (TUS); wife of the 53rd Dāʿī, Syedna Khuzaima Qutbuddin (RA); sister-in-law of the 52nd Dāʿī, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin (RA); daughter-in-law and niece of the 51st Dāʿī, Syedna Taher Saifuddin (RA); and granddaughter of the 49th Dāʿī, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin (RA).
Her father, Rasul Hudood Syedi Ibrahim bhaisaheb Zainuddin, and her mother, al-Sayyida al-Fadila Fatema bensaheba, nurtured her in faith and learning. Guided by their example—and blessed by the teachings and nazaraat of Syedna Taher Saifuddin (RA)—she grew in both scholarship and devotion. She prays for hours, recites tasbeeh with deep focus, and completes a full reading of the Qur’an each day in Ramadan. 
A devoted mother of nine, she raised her children in faith, fortitude, and aspiration. Alongside Syedna Qutbuddin (RA), she inculcated in them—sons and daughters—the importance of education and the ethic of service. Her grandchildren find in her a fountain of gentle affection. In every role—daughter, wife, mother, counsellor, teacher, scholar, benefactor, believer, devotee, and poet—she reflects resilience, sincerity, devotion, warmth, generosity and grace. She is, truly, the epitome of Muslim womanhood—my mother, an inspiration to me and to us all.
At a time when few women studied beyond home, she attended Cathedral School and Sophia College, graduating with honours in English literature and a B.Ed., also teaching there for two years. She reads widely and now especially appreciates political commentary and historical works. She has long loved Shakespeare, Milton, Emerson, and Frost—poets who helped shape her own voice.
Sakina Busaheba began composing poetry in the early 1960s and continues to this day. This beautiful and intimate collection is a mirror of her life and her faith—of devotion, gratitude, and love. Within these pages are 220 poems in praise of Allah, in awe at the circle of life, in remembrance of the Panjetan Paak, and in devotion to the Da’is of her time—many written in elegy for her noble husband, Syedna Khuzaima Qutbuddin (RA). They come from the heart and they touch the heart—they will be recited and savoured for generations to come.

I Have Achieved Everything 
In silent, contemplative moments,
I think to myself
that I have achieved nothing:
no might, no muscle,
no strength, no space,
no purpose, no pride,
so pathetic, so puny.


But then I think of you, O Maula Ali,
my heart throbbing your name,
your love pervading my soul,
each drop of my blood,
each breath I take,
calling out to you, O Maula Ali.


And I say
I have achieved everything.
________________


So, We Swam
It is the time of the seclusion of the Imam.
Men of God suffer,
men of faith, men of grace, men of honour suffer.


And you, my beloved, suffered.
A life spent in suffering —
and then you were gone.


We were rudderless,
adrift in a turbulent ocean.
But you had taught us to swim,
to swim against adversity.


So … we swam.

The Potter and the Pot
The Almighty
created the mighty man.
But is there any comparison
between the potter
and the pot?
________________
 
What Fear Do I Have of Death 
With the name of Allah on my lips,
with the faith of Mohammed and Ali in my heart,
with the tears of Fatema to wash away my sins,
with the love of Hasan and Husain in my blood —


what fear do I have of death?


________________


Hurr Chooses Husain
It is a tale of Hurr,
commander of the army of Yazid.


He has a choice.
Every human has a choice.
He is the master of his every action.


The distance between paradise and hellfire
is eons apart,
yet they are as close
as the two beatings of a human heart.


And Hurr
chooses Husain.
________________


When the Waves Engulf 
When the waves engulf them like shadows, 
they call upon God,
sincere in their faith, pure in their plea.
But when He delivers them safely to the shore,
some turn lukewarm once more.
“And none deny Our signs except the ungrateful traitor.”
Fakhruddin Maula
I was walking in the storm,
holding Qutbuddin Maula’s hand.
There was thunder and lightning;
it was dark and wet.


Then I looked up —
and Fakhruddin Maula
was holding my hand.


Let the storm rage!
I knew I was safe.
From one benevolent father
to another benevolent father,
I had nothing to fear.

What Do You Say
What do you say to a friend
who gives you a helping hand?
Thank you.


What do you say to your parents
who have given you life and nurtured you?
I am eternally grateful.


What do you say to Mohammed and Ali
who have given you heaven
and saved you from hell?


Our hearts are full
and our lips silent.

I Am Part of Husain
Rasulullah, the Prophet of Islam, has said:
I am part of Husain,
and Husain is part of me.


O Yazid, O Shimr —
did you slay the Prophet
in Karbala?

When You Left Me
When you left me,
the rose lost its bloom,
the sun lost its shine,
the moon lost its coolness,
the stars lost their sparkle,
the mountains lost their majesty.


When will we meet again?


When we meet again,
will you hold my hand,
and lead me
into heavenly bliss?

Iqra — The First Command
It was an age of ignorance — 
ignorance of the Oneness of Allah, 
ignorance of modesty,
ignorance of peace,
ignorance of the worth of women.


Then Jibreel descended upon Mohammed 
with a message from the Lord of all worlds,
saying, “In the name of Allah, recite! — Iqra.”


And ignorance was dispelled,
darkness gave way to light,
and the radiance of Islam
spread and enveloped the world.
Heaven Is Waiting for You
Heaven has countless meanings — 
it is here, upon this earth,
it is in the person of the Imam and Dai, 
it lies at a mother’s feet,
it is near, it is far.
For a Mumin, it is a certainty.


But O my brothers and sisters in faith,
ask yourselves —
do you want to be a master there, or a slave?


Do good here, and you shall be a master.
Do evil, and you shall be a slave.
The choice is yours.


Yet remember —
heaven is waiting for you.
“In the Name of Allah, Read!”
“In the name of Allah, read!”


Why would Allah command Mohammed to read?
Because Mohammed could read the why and wherefore of the farthest sky,
the reason for the sun, moon, and stars.
the mystery of the human soul.


He knew the secrets hidden in the deepest ocean,
the majesty of the highest mountain. 
He knew what had passed before him,
and what was yet to come,
even unto the Last Day.


And the Quran says:
“There is no wet or dry thing but it is contained in the Quran.”


That Quran is Mohammed.


The Lionesses of Karbala
It is the evening of Ashura.
Husain and his seventy-two have been slain,
no man remains, save for Zainul Abedin.


Then from the hot sands arise the heroines of Karbala,
of the house of Ali and Fatema,
of the house of Mohammed and Khadija.


Their very names speak of suffering,
of endurance beyond measure, 
beyond the grasp of the mind,
beyond the strength of flesh,
into the realm where pain itself falls silent.


Yet they suffered.
They witnessed.
They endured.


They were the women of Karbala
who stood with their men,
hungered and thirsted with their men,
and when their men were gone,
they remained
without father or brother,
without husband or son.


They lived for one purpose —
to serve their Maula, Ali Zainul Abedin,
to fulfill the dying wish of their brother, Husain.
 
How could they rise
after seeing the slaughter of Husain?
How could they look upon the ruins of hope
and still stand tall?


From those very sands, two lionesses rose — 
Zainab and Umme Kulsum.
Their voices shook the palaces of power,
their roar brought Yazid and his throne
crashing to the ground.


And the name of Husain
reverberated through the ages,
echoing still,
forever.
________________
The Sun Rises
The sun rises,
and darkness melts away.
Naseem, the gentle morning breeze,
whispers through the air.
All is well with the world.


Mumineen beseech their Maula,
their Maula answers with blessings unbound.
Life stirs anew,
hope awakens once more.
All is well with the world.


The Boulder
A boulder hurtles down the slope,
crushing tender, juicy saplings,
cruelly trampling small blue flowers.


Below lies a village
with human interests, human joys, human tears.
But I have no hope,
save a single, screeching will
to stop it
from reaching its tragic end.


And forever echoes the eternal, infinite How?
How? Why?


Perhaps the ground gave way beneath its weight.
Perhaps no vines had grown
to bind it to the mountaintop.
Perhaps it deliberately wrenched its gaze away
from the fleecy cloud above,
that veiled the peak
from scrutiny, from understanding, from nearness.


O God of the clouds,
save the village from destruction.
Halt the boulder’s headlong fall
by Your mercy,
that reaches even
to the deep mires of evil.
My Maula Is Taller Than the Mountain
If calamity were to descend upon the tallest mountain,
as it fell upon you, O Maula Ali,
the mountain would crumble to dust.


If floods were to engulf the earth,
as sorrow drowned your soul, O Maula Ali,
the waters would sweep away all that is green and living.


If earthquakes were to rend the ground,
as grief tore through your life, O Maula Ali,
the earth would become a gaping chasm.


Yet you, my Maula,
are taller than the mountain,
purer than the water,
stronger than the trembling earth.

Calm Depths
Calm depths
in fathoms upon fathoms of blue,
like an underground stream,
crystal-clear, cool, and pure.


Or like the swaying silence,
the deep peace of the setting sun,
where light glances from fresh, wet leaves
green with life,
vibrant with health.


Spectators watch in awe,
marveling at the miracle of life,
of knowledge, of love,
of tenderness, of strength.


Who is He?
Can we bear to open our eyes
to such brilliance?


Only when He draws us
into the depths of His gaze,
into His mercy, His bounty.


Not love for another,
for He has made us
His own.


1963


Where Does It Come From
Where does it come from? 
Does it flow from His open arms?
It is a mystery —
for men still sorrow,
for men still die,
for men still linger, watching the birds fly,
watching the rainbow disappear.


But where — or how?
The rain falls to caress the seedling,
lying hidden beneath the ground,
guarding its secret, thirsting in silence.


As Time flows, so shall it flow on,
unending, though men close their hearts and eyes,
and turn their backs —
still it seeps through scent and sound,
till they are worn with ache and wonder.

Born Unto You 
All that is beautiful and true
is bound with You, my Lord —
the surge of life, the pulse of confidence,
the surer step, steadfast in wisdom,
making the world gleam green and deep,
fresh from cooling, falling rain;
the sun shining on dew-laden flowers,
heavy with mercy, overcome,
urging them to rise with the joy of embrace,
or simply to bring a smile to waiting lips.


To behold this vast, perplexing, magnificent
creation of joy and exuberance
is to behold Your work, my Lord,
the shaping of Your artistic hands.


The earth may spin itself into a living meteor,
yet You will take my love,
flowing through my lifeblood,
and draw me into Your immortal being —
living in love,
till thought dissolves,
and I am born unto You.

Aqa Mohammed Burhanuddin
Aqa Mohammed Burhanuddin
You are the Dai of Husain,
bringing his message of patience and pain,
with barakaat that fall like gentle rain —
Aqa Mohammed Burhanuddin.


A priceless pearl among Doat Mutlaqeen,
beloved son of Aqa Taher Saifuddin,
the light of their lineage, serene —
Aqa Mohammed Burhanuddin.


To you we bow our heads in shukur and humility,
seeking your gaze, the gift of closest sublimity,
alive within us through all eternity —
Aqa Mohammed Burhanuddin.


My daughter, Tahera Bazat,
may she forever remain in your khidmat,
and give her all in the service of Dawat —
Aqa Mohammed Burhanuddin.


May you live in glory everlasting,
with all the blessing of creation never ending,
your glory ever and ever and ever increasing —
Aqa Mohammed Burhanuddin.




The Search for the Real 
All that glitters is not gold,
all that shines is not real,
all who claim to speak the truth
are not always true.


But, O God, how shall I find
the gold, the real, the truth?
I have not the eye of a jeweler,
nor the skill of a craftsman,
nor the wisdom of a sage.


And He says:
do not look far,
do not seek the dazzle,
do not search for the truth —
look for Me.


Then silence gathers our voices,
our eyes roam the horizon,
and the heart whispers —
Allah.

The Moon in Ali’s House
It was a night of rejoicing.
The full moon had entered Ali’s house.
The heavens lit up.
The earth gleamed lush and full.


Then tragedy struck.
The moon no longer dwells in Ali’s home.
Kicked by cruel feet,
slapped by cruel hands —
Fatema is no more.


Ali is alone —
Fatema is no more.
The children weep —
Fatema is no more.
The earth is dark —
Fatema is no more.


Yet, behold! 
The heavens light up —
Fatema is here.
Yaa Ali 
In the inner precincts of the Kaaba, 
A child is born.
His name is Ali.


The first to be taken into Mohammed’s arms is the infant Ali. 
The one nurtured in Mohammed’s house is the child Ali.
The first to embrace Islam is the young Ali.


In Hijra, to sleep in Mohammed’s bed is Ali. 
In Badr, the shield of Mohammed is Ali.
In Uhud, the companion of Mohammed is Ali. 
In Khandaq, in Khaibar, the Lion of God is Ali. 


The spouse of Fatema is Ali.
The father of Hasan and Husain is Ali.
In Ghadeer, the chosen successor of Mohammed is Ali, 
After Mohammed death, the one who buries him is Ali.


In the heavens, there is Ali.
In North, South, East, and West, there is Ali.
At the Lake of Kausar, there is Ali.


With hands raised in supplication, I plead:
Grant me a sip of that pure water, Yaa Ali!
One Day, Two Faces
The Day of Judgement and Doomsday are one.
For the wicked, it is the end — Doomsday.
For the faithful, it is reckoning — Judgement Day.
There are debts to pay,
but mercy awaits.
For them,
heaven is assured.
Think of Husain
When you are alone, think of Husain.
When grief overwhelms you, think of Husain.
When you are thirsty, think of Husain.
When you cradle a child, think of Husain.
When you come to a wedding, think of Husain.
When you are in pain, think of Husain.
When you feel forsaken, think of Husain.


You are never forsaken.
Husain is with you.










The Extravagant Painter
The extravagant painter
Ever the same, and eternally vivid,
He paints the horizon in scarlet, orange, and gold,
the landscape in soothing greens of every hue,
lighting monotony
with dainty flowers,
and men’s minds
with the highest sentiments,
with ideals of eternity.


His touch purifies into beauty;
His truth is beauty,
His light is beauty,
His love, creation, compassion,
bears no comparison.


The black trees at night reach up to the sky;
they sing and wave praises in the morning light.
The wasteland stretches far away,
yet here and there blooms the fruitfulness
of indescribable loveliness.


He holds the universe
in the palm of His hand,
yet has the tenderness
to reach the innermost recesses
of the human soul.


January 1961


Only You
All else is transient, ever changing.
Only You remain, constant, unchanging.


Grant me a sign, a whisper of assurance.
Look upon me with mercy,
a smile upon Your lips,
answering my silent plea.
By the Grace of the Divine Pen 
The future is bleak —
it is as it was, as it is.


If death should come in twenty years,
the tale will remain the same.
No growth, no service, no khidmat.


Tomorrow I may bow my head,
but today I ask: why?


Forgive my sins.
Grant me the chance to serve.
Give strength to my pen—
by the grace of the Divine Pen.


Let me write of the Lord’s glory,
of His Creation, His Prophet, His Ali.
Let me write of the Imams—
their saintliness, their perfection.


Let me show the world
the power of faith,
the power of conviction,
the power of will.


What else is open to me?
All other doors are closed.
I stand alone,
hedged in, suffocated.


Let me pour my heart into words.
Grant me the thought, give me the words, 
for both come from You.


Let them rise to You in praise,
let them rise to You in repentance.
Let them find depth at Your door
in prostration, in supplication, in plea.


Do not turn them away.
Do not reject them.
For I have none to turn to,
nor do I wish to.


If You are my hope,
then I place my hope in none other.


The Weight of Being Alone
What it is to be alone,
alone in a crowd,
alone among loved ones.


Sitting solitary at night, with all asleep:
the trees silent,
the wind silent,
the birds, the people, silent.


To be alone — I like it.
To feel alone — that is tragic.


To be given sight, then cast into darkness.
Ears to hear with, then the silence of abandoned loneliness.
The wish to give, and no one to receive.
To love, and nothing in return.


Frustration. Hopelessness.
A blank wall at every turn.
Days pass by, and nights,
nothing accomplished, nothing fulfilled.


So much fruit unplucked,
so much water unharnessed,
so much good intention wasted.


Death will come barging in tomorrow,
and the question will be:
What have you done?
What have you done with the time given you?


And I will bow my head in shame.
No excuse. No pleading.
I have done nothing,
affected nothing,
accomplished nothing.


But no. There is still time.
I will prepare provisions for my journey
and return home.




O Maula Ali
O Maula Ali!
You are the blaze of the sun,
the coolness of the moon,
the sparkle of the stars,
the rhythm of the turning spheres.


You are life-giving rain,
the sweetness of honey,
the fragrance of the rose.


You are my all —
the ecstasy lies in reaching you.
The Price of a Promise
My brothers and sisters in faith,
what is the price of a promise?


It was paid in the heat and sand of Karbala.
It lives in the sacrifice of the seventy-two,
in the blood of Ali Asghar and Ali Akbar,
in the torment of thirst,
in the mashki of Abbas,
in the slaughter of Husain.


The price of a promise
is everlasting peace.


The Pain is in the Pulse
The pain is in the pulse,
the strength is in the blood.
The ache is in the heart,
the loss is in the child.
The bereavement is in the brother,
the courage is in the kin,
the loyalty is in the seventy-two.


O Husain!
They have not slaughtered you,
for you have risen.
Follow Me
Allah has created beauty
out of dull, drab dust,
He has woven a thousand colours:
of leaves and flowers,
of birds and beasts.


From the one, He created the many.
From death, He brought forth life.


The mighty tree sleeps within the seed,
the free spirit is entrapped in clay.
Will gross matter weigh the spirit down,
or will the spirit raise it to itself?
Will the seed burst forth into a tree,
or decay into the mud it came from?


Then Allah sends His Prophet to show the way —
the way to life beyond death:
the death of ignorance,
the death of disbelief,
the death of imprisonment of the soul.


He says, Follow Me,
and I will lead you to eternal life,
to freedom, to knowledge, to belief.


He asks:
Why the earth?
Why the sky, the stars, the sun?
Why beauty, and why decay?
Why man, and why you?


He says, Follow Me, and I will answer your why,
and your why for and wherein.


He asks:
Why beauty and ugliness?
Why pure and impure?
Why good and evil?
Why contentment and despair?
Why abundance and starvation?




For all, there is an answer:
Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.

Rejoice, O Mumineen 
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Be happy and gay!
We shall leave this mud and quagmire,
and find salvation with our Maula,
And immunity from hell and hellfire.

Rejoice! Rejoice! O Mumineen!
For Mohammed is our saviour from pain,
and Ali, Fatema, Hasan, and Husain —
their barakaat fall upon us like showers of rain.




The Story of Husain
The story of Husain,
the tragedy of Karbala,
written not with the pen but with blood.
Maula Husain, with a thousand wounds,
life ebbing out with each faltering step —
the anguish of the earth, the sky, and the throne above,
the anguish of the sea, the air.
Allah Created a Magnificent Man
Allah created a magnificent man,
gave him a sublime soul,
gave him unsurpassed strength,
gave him a marvellous mind.


But…
man is clever but also cruel,
man is kind but also a killer,
man is wise but also a vagrant.


Allah is all-knowing and all-seeing,
even to the deepest recess of the human heart —
and judgement lies beyond the grave.
A Tear is an Amazing Thing
A tear is an amazing thing,
it brings together the heart, soul, mind, and body
into a small drop of water flowing from the eyes.


What is the price of that tear?
If it is for joy, it brings happiness,
if it is for grief, it brings sadness.


But if the tears of a Mumin are for Husain,
they will earn him eight heavens.
If they are Fatema’s tears for a Mumin,
they will save him from hellfire
and grant him entry into Jannat and life everlasting.


So, Mumin,
cry your heart out —
heaven awaits you.
From “La Ilaha” to “Illa -llah”
To turn La Ilaha into Illa -llah,
to turn the hopeless into hope,
ignorance into light,
hell into heaven,
death into life,
sorrow into ecstasy,
darkness into dawn —


come, O Mumin,
come to Islam and to Iman,
and you are home.
Being is Life
Being is life.
Life is breath, thought, and love.

Life is also to believe —
believe in Allah,
His Prophet, and Ali,
their successors, the Imams,
their successors, the Dais.


O Mumin, believe —
heaven is here in their shade,
and heaven is your destiny tomorrow.
Come to the Door of Ali
Come one, come all,
come to the door of Ali.
Man, woman, child,
come to the door of Ali.
All of humanity,
come as you are.


Unburden your hearts,
shed your pain and weariness,
lay down your sorrow,
leave behind your fear.


Come to the door of Ali —
the door of forgiveness,
the door of hope,
the door of fulfilment,
the door of mercy,
the door where the troubles of the world
are washed away.


Come one, come all —
come to the door of Ali.
Life-Giving Water
The Quran says, “From water We have created every living thing,”
but there is no water in Karbala.
The Furat is close by,
but there is no water with Husain.


The seventy-two do not sacrifice their lives for water.
Abbas, Ali Akbar, Ali Asghar,
they do not die for water.


They gaze upon Husain,
they see the pond of Kausar in the blades of swords,
they see Ali standing beside the pond of Kausar,
and they ride toward the enemy,
smiling, joyous.


They are going home,
home to heaven,
home to everlasting life with Husain.
What more can they hope for,
ask for,
pray for?


That in truth
is life-giving water.
Subhan Allah
Allah created the cosmos.
Why, where, when, how? Allah knows.
The farthest heavens, the nearest hells,
Allah created the earth,
in all its grandeur and minutiae.


From the first man
to generations unending.
He created the Holy Five —
Mohammed, Ali, Fatema, Hasan, Husain.


Subhan Allah,
Subhan Allah,
Subhan Allah!
The Transience of Glory
Knowing yet deceiving himself
Man takes pleasure in temporary gains 
When the eternity of nature is unnoticed.


All have turned out to see the queen,
neglecting their work,
enduring discomfort
for a fleeting glimpse of transient royalty
passing as a flash before the eyes,
acknowledging the homage of thousands,
adored for the mere quality of a name.


There is more peace
in the soft lapping of waves
as they run through the pebbles on the shore,
or in the swarm of white
as the doves bob with tranquillity.


Knowing, yet deceiving himself,
man takes pleasure in temporary gains,
while the eternity of nature
passes unnoticed.

When the Sun Lies Down
The sun pillows on billowy clouds,
softly laying to sleep as night creeps on,
its fierce brightness subdued,
molten, turning to a furnace of red.


A turbulent heart keeps vigil.
Birds swoop and soar
with gliding grace,
framed against a violet sky,
bidding farewell to the dying sun.


Others have suffered before me,
and will suffer after me,
but time stands still today —
and it hurts like hell.


December 1960


Earth Accepts
The sunbeam reaches the earth,
the earth accepts and all is aglow.
The rain falls,
the land drinks thirstily,
and the brown turns green and lush.


The trees offer themselves,
the birds swoop in,
and it is lonely no more.


________________


You Accept the Light of Faiz, O Syedna Taher Saifuddin 
Your acceptance, O most exalted one, 
of the dazzling light of faiz,
is the acceptance of lightning,
the comprehension of a powerful intellect.


You accept from the Imam, 
and disseminate,
so that the light of eternity may flow,
glowing bright, 
illumining our understanding.


You are the gate of heaven.
Through you we enter
and glimpse His holiness.


The Twelfth Night
It is the twelfth night of the month of Rabi the First.
The moon is shining, the stars are twinkling,
the silence is complete.
God’s good creation is waiting —
the spheres, the stones, the dust,
the butterflies, the birds,
the fish, the foam,
the forests, the flowers,
waiting, waiting,
waiting for the birth of a godly child  —


a child pure and perfect,
a child graceful and good,
a child beautiful,
a child who always was and always will be —
Mohammed, Mehmood.


In the barren sands of Bat’ha,
in the holy precinct of the Kaaba,
in the house of Abdullah and Aamenah,
a child is born.

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Be happy and joyful!
Give thanks to Allah in prostration and pray
with reverence in your heart and say:
La Ilaha Illa -llah,
Mohammadun Rasulullah,
Aliyyun Waliullah.
Truth is Here
Truth is here.
Truth is oh so near.


Touch it
and you will feel its gentleness.
Reach out
and you will feel its hold.


When you find truth,
do not let go
till life itself lets go.


When hands grow slack,
when the grip unfolds,
when the curtain rises,
truth stands before you,
face to face.

O Mumin
O Mumin,
cry your eyes out —
it is still not enough for Husain.


Beat your chest,
till your hands are numb —
it is still not enough for Husain.


For Husain gave his life for you,
Husain sacrificed his sons for you,
he sacrificed his beloved brother for you,
he sacrificed his loyal seventy-two for you.


O Mumin,
if you cry for him, it is not enough.
If you beat your chest, it is not enough.
Even if you die for him,
it is not enough.


But keep crying for Husain, 
keep beating your chest for Husain.
Allah has a paradise
waiting for those who do.








The Big Question
The big question is — why?
Why this universe?
Why the sun, the moon, the stars?
Why the earth,
this inhabitable, hospitable place?


Why life-giving oxygen?
Why plants of a thousand kinds?
Why animals of a thousand kinds?
Why man?


The when and wherefore are secondary —
the question is why.


But He knows
and Maula knows.
Come to the Qubba of Qutbuddin Maula
Come to the Qubba of Qutbuddin Maula,
come to the shade of the date trees,
come to the shade of the Quran.


Come to where your prayers are heard,
come to where your wishes are granted,
come to where your heart is unburdened.


Come, come, Mumineen —
Qutbuddin Maula is ready to give.
If you ask him, he will give.
He will give even if you don’t.


Raudat un Noor
Raudat un Noor —
a rhapsody of marble,
an elevation in the hills,
a light in the darkness,
a hope amidst despair,
a vision fulfilled.


An elevation touching the skies,
a dream made reality.


Come one, come all —
let the shade of the Quran cover you,
let your wishes come true,
let your prayers be answered.


For inside lies a Maula with a heart like the sea —
he will answer your prayers.

The Waterfall
How beautiful is the waterfall,
how splendid,
how magnificent.


The broad sheet of water cascading down,
how awesome.
Yet, does it hurt
when it dashes against the rocks?


Is the spray that rises
a cry of its wail?
The rainbow that springs from it —
does its beauty come from its raw ache?


Then the power is reduced to calmness —
a pool of pure, cool water,
a place of contemplation and thought,
a place of peace after pain.
The Seed of Man
Allah has created life through me.
Through love, through intimacy, He has created
this small child, so helpless, so helpless —
no will, no volition,
no strength, no reason.


But in him is the seed of man —
the seed of mind and intellect,
the seed of emotion and passion,
the seed of good and evil.


A seed becoming a being —
a trickle becoming a torrent.


Man can fly higher than the birds,
he can dive deeper than the fishes,
he can scale the highest mountain,
he can touch the moon —


with the power of his mind,
the strength of his intellect,
the will of his soul.




The Gift of a Child
Accidents, my friend?
Accidents never happen.
Allah wills all, plans all, ordains all, sustains all.


A small raindrop falls,
for it should.
It would not,
if it should not.


A snowflake flutters to the ground,
for it should.


An ant is trampled by unknowing feet,
an ant is not trampled unknown.


A pebble falls into the stream.
He knows.
A leaf flutters to the ground.
He knows.
A man thinks, feels.
He knows.


This gift of a child is for you,
this child is for you.
He knows.

A Baby Child
By the spinning of the heavens,
was a baby born.
By the light of the stars,
was a baby born.
By the wafting of the winds,
was a baby born.
By the abundance of water,
was a baby born.
By the generosity of the earth,
was a baby born.


Man and woman —
you are the recipients of Allah’s bounty and blessing.
You have been given the essence
of the sun, the stars, the heaven, and the earth.


You have created,
nay, Allah has created 
a gift for you —
a baby child.

The Path of Islam and Imaan
Follow the straight path
and you reach your goal.
Veer from it,
and you land in hell.


The straight path is narrow and sharp.
But follow it steadily,
follow it diligently,
and you reach your goal.
The Perfect Man
Who is the perfect man,
one who is fair of face,
one who is pure of heart,
one who is trustworthy — al-Amin,
one who is generous,
most importantly,
one who is chosen by Allah?

Mohammed, whom the ignorant call unlettered,
who read the message of Islam,
who read the magnificent Quran,
who dispelled ignorance with wisdom,
who prophesied the coming of Judgement Day,
who made lowly man capable of reaching heaven.


He is the perfect man.
Islam is Beautiful
Islam is beautiful,
Islam is graceful.
Islam pervades the home.

Islam is tolerant,
Islam is vast.
Islam encompasses the world in its heart.


It gives solace in old age,
and is the light that shines
through the darkness of the world
to the worlds beyond.
O Husain
O Husain!
I pray to the Almighty,
I pray to you.
Stay in my heart,
stay inside of my heart always,
that I may feel your pain to ease my own,
that my blood may pulse
with the sorrow of your tragedy,
for that is my only solace.


I know that when my heart reaches out to you,
when my whole being entreats you, begs you, implores you,
you will answer my call,
you will give me solace,
you will give me patience and forbearance,
you will give me the strength to carry on —
for how else to endure
from day to day, from hour to hour?


Silently, one endures —
and the beloved is silent,
watching, knowing not what to do.


Husain is in heaven,
I stand next to his Zarih —
that hallowed and sacred place
where God and His angels
bear every word uttered
to the Throne of the Almighty.


Where sinners come,
and their sins are forgiven.
I am a sinner — not worthy to stand by that hallowed place,
I am dust,
I am a speck of dust —
but he hears my voice.


He has said so.
And if not — what will happen
to the inner voice
that nobody cares to listen to?


O Husain —
it will suffocate,
and be forever silent.


But you, O Husain —
you breathe life into silence,
turning grief into remembrance,
and remembrance into light.
You make sorrow a prayer,
and silence
a song of love.


Mazoon-e-Dawat, O Maula Burhanuddin
The sunbeams reach the earth,
the earth accepts, and all is aglow.
The rain falls, the land drinks thirstily,
and the parched soil grows lush and green.
The trees offer their branches,
the birds fly in, and the earth is lonely no more.


The light of divine inspiration shines,
Mazoon-e-Dawat receives and gathers,
faiz is aglow and flowing,
the showers of wisdom fall,
he accepts.


The desert blooms,
his saintly spirituality beckons,
the children of Dawat, through him, accept.
Solace prevails and despair is dispelled.


O exalted guide, Maula Burhanuddin,
your higher acceptance, born of insight rare,
provides the gateway wherein, entering, Mumineen
experience a personality compelling,
comprehend the light of eternity,
a force ennobling —
through you, they know, realize, and serve
beloved Dai Taher Saifuddin.


1960s
He Came to Khadija
O Allah,
who cares for His creation —
why did You abandon Your Prophet
when he conveyed Your message of peace and Islam?


He was laughed at,
he was ridiculed,
he was desecrated,
he was tortured.


And He replies:
We sent him Khadija
to serve him,
to solace him,
to calm him,
to comfort him,
to share his pain with him.


So, after the tribulations of the Meccans,
he came to Khadija.
He was home.
You Win Either Way
Death and life are two parts of one truth.
In death, there is loss of life.
In life, there is victory over death.


Neither surpasses the other,
for in death, for a Mumin,
heaven is his abode,
and in life, he strives for that excellence.


O Mumin,
you win either way —
living or dying.

When Will We Meet Again
How do I miss you?
Let me count the ways —


as the setting sun yearns to rise again,
as the sliver of the moon longs to be full again,
as the earth yearns for the rain,
as the rain anticipates the rainbow,
as the trees welcome the birds,
as the roses share their fragrance —
so, I miss you.


When will we meet again?


At the Feet of Husain
Husain has come to Karbala,
with his women and children,
and an army of seventy-two.


They are loyal in their love for Husain,
they are sure in their salvation with Husain,
they are true in trust with Husain.


They are nurtured by the nobility of Husain,
they are grateful for the generosity of Husain,
they feel pain for the pain of Husain.


They will be the shield against the killing of Husain,
they will fight unto death in defense of Husain,
they will give their lives for love of Husain.


Then they will be forever in paradise
at the feet of Husain.
The Accounting
The earth accepts all —
the rich, the poor,
the king, the slave,
the man, the woman,
the old, the young.


Then the accounting will begin.

Life Everlasting
A child is born,
he grows up to be a Muslim, a Mumin.
He grows old,

But he is born again —
in life everlasting.

 The Grief of Husain
The grief of Husain is an amazing thing.
A Mumin cries his heart out in sorrow,
knowing full well
that he will be at the feet of Husain —
in ecstasy.

The Aura of the Holy Five
No lightning can strike me,

Justice from Allah
It rains, it drizzles, it thunders, it strikes. 
It nurtures, it floods, it destroys.
Everything that happens

________________
The Holy Five Reunited
Husain has reached Karbala,
a land of anguish.


Mohammed, Ali, Fatema, Hasan have passed away.
They look down from their heavenly abode.


Ali sees his son, Abbas, 
riding hard to reach the tents and the children,
his two arms cut off,
his mouth holding the vessel of precious water,
falling, killed.
Mohammed sees the baby Ali
murdered in Husain’s arms.
Fatema has cleared the place of thorns
where Husain is to be slain.
Hasan sees his brother stretched on the burning sand,
Shimr advancing, a dull knife in his cruel hand.


Karbala is written in history with torture and blood,
and in our hearts with agony and pain.
But the Holy Five
are reunited again
in heaven.

The Six Trees
One tree went, another came; when the second tree withered, the third rose, and when it had exhausted its age, the fourth bloomed to give the sweet fragrance of remembrance of the third. When the fourth was passing away, the fifth was ready to take its place. When the fifth was ready to go, the time had come for the blossoming of the sixth. Time passed — and the sixth tree blossomed.


Every tree in blossoming followed the divine order and passed away only after the appointed time; it did not eternally subsist, yet its fragrance remained. The young, blossoming tree served as a remembrance of the one that had passed away.


Unique are the trees, and unique their tales, passing through centuries. Whom shall we ask about them? Where shall we search for their secret? Perhaps on some far-distant shore we shall meet someone, or on the lonely heights of some mountain. Or is it not somebody hiding the secret in some deserted garden of palms, far from the crowded city?


Whom shall we ask? Who will explain — six trees that are centuries old? After all, how vast is this earth, and where can such a secret lie?


Dear friend, do not wander afar: search for the secret in the recesses of your soul. After searching for the answer in my heart again and again, I received only one reply — surely you will discover these trees.


Are you surprised? How is that? The heart knows that every tree is unique; when one passed away another bloomed to take its place, not only inheriting the virtues of the dying plant but adding the particular quality of its own, becoming even more special.


You may protest that we already know this, but have patience — why don’t we ask the sixth tree? How? Are you surprised?


My dear, the sixth tree has come to life after the fifth passed away. Yes — I see joy dancing in the light of your eyes. I thought you were satisfied with the idea that the sixth tree is with us, and that it can unfold the mysteries of its predecessors — let us go to it.


Wait a moment. I think that despite believing that the sixth tree exists, we do not know where to find it.

Think deep, with complete faith in God — we will meet tomorrow.

 When Love Lasts Through Old Age
When love lasts through old age,
after the first passion subsides,
when children have grown
and have lives of their own —


If there is still time
to talk together,
about matters beyond
the day-to-day mundane things,
then that relationship is love.


If not,
then age has taken its toll
physically,
and emotionally.

Heaven’s Doorstep        
If I have fervour in my heart for Mohammed,
if I have passion in my soul for Ali,
if I have sorrow in my being for Fatema,
if I have endurance in my existence for Hasan,
if I have tears in my eyes for Husain,
I am at heaven’s doorstep —
nay, I am already in heaven.

Hurr at the Crossroads
Hurr is at the crossroads.
One road leads to Yazid,
paved with wealth and worldly triumph.
The other road leads to Husain,
paved with death and agony.


He chooses Husain
for the wealth of heaven,
and the ultimate victory.

Inspire Me, O Allah
Be willing to grasp my failing hand.
Let me not drown in the mud of mindlessness
thinking of nothing but food, and dress, and empty things.


Inspire me, O Allah.
O Allah, inspire me to write, to write, to write.
Inspire me to lose myself in thoughts of You,
so that worldly occasions affect only surface strings,
painful, but passing.


What remains always, forever,
are thoughts of You, O Allah,
compelling me to put this on paper,
for therein is the balm,
therein is the medicine,
therein is the cure,
therein is health.


If You give me this, all else is unimportant.
If You give me this, all pain is gone.
If You give me this, all hopelessness becomes hope.


There are vistas and horizons before me,
far-out, everywhere —
fresh winds blowing without limit,
the heart bursting with thought,
the mind drowned in emotion,
enjoying every moment of life,
exhilarating in its beauty and miracle.


You are the Giver of Life.
Give me the vision of hope,
colouring nature with rosy hues,
changing gloom into shining rays of light.


Do I ask too much?
Is it too much to demand?
I know I have sinned.
I am drowned in sin —
I have sinned so much that I have not the right to raise my head,
nor ask You for anything at all.
But You have given me life.
Now I ask You to give me Your gift of khidmat,
without which life is meaningless, dark, sad, without joy.


Let me not meet the end with no credit, only tears.
Let me not meet the end with no service performed.


Allah is All-Knowing, Just, Merciful, and Omnipotent.
O Allah, temper justice with mercy.
Forgive me my sins, overlook my faults.


My ignorance is overwhelming,
my knowledge is puny.


O Allah, You who are Omnipotent and Merciful,
give me knowledge, that I may recognize You.
Give me the will to act according to Your will.
Give me faith to love You unfailingly.
Give me a heart that beats against the buffeting storms.


How does it survive?
How does it pass through?
It is a miracle, or yet another punishment?


Yet even in punishment, there is mercy.
Even in pain, there is Your presence.
For wherever I turn, You are there —
and in that knowing, O Allah,
my soul finds rest.
The Creator and the Created
Allah is the Creator of the farthest galaxies,
and the closest earth,
of the largest planet and the smallest,
and everything in between,


of the coldest Pluto,
and the hottest sun,
of the tallest mountain,
and the deepest volcano,


of the lush forest,
and the driest Sahara.
of godly men and evil beings,


of Ali and Husain, perfect men,
and of Yazid and Muawiyah
who made themselves evil.


We are lovers of Ali and Husain,
we are on the path to heaven.

O lovers of Muawiyah and Yazid —
you can go to hell!

How Shall We Thank You
How shall we thank You?
Do honour, reverence, homage before You?
Kneel to beg Your mercy and prayers?


Since to repay You is beyond
what our passing minutes will allow —
even the treasures of Your love
elude our heart’s grasp.


Your strength, Your power, overpowers.
Your mercy engulfs, flooding,
pervading our hearts and minds.


You have given us ourselves,
our souls to purify in sacrifice,
lives to illuminate in Your service,
happiness and joy together,
blessings of a little life
enriched with Your love,
and those little gifts
as natural as the light and the wind,
as flowing as a torrential river.


So we shall thank You
as the world thanks the sun, the moon, the stars
for making it bright
by shining with their brilliance.


As the flowers thank the sky
for bringing rain in mercy
by giving off their fragrance.


As man thanks the air
for allowing him to breathe
by service to Him
who has given him more than breath,
more than light,
more than sight,
colour, life, purpose, destiny.

Karbala is Husain and Husain is Karbala
Husain is journeying towards Karbala
to pay a debt,
a debt he will pay in blood and thirst,
a debt he will pay by sacrifice and agony,
a debt he promised Mohammed he would pay,
a debt discharged for thousands of years to come.


The sun is scorching,
the sand is blistering.


Husain is slaughtered.
Abbas, Ali Akbar, Ali Asghar are slaughtered.
The faithful seventy-two are killed.


But the land of Karbala is blessed.
Husain and his faithful are here.


Karbala is Husain,

My Dream Will Become a Reality
Heaven is described for us
as a place of bliss,
free from all trials and tribulations of life.


A place where rivers flow,
rivers of milk and honey,

A place where Ali
is standing at the pool of Kausar.


When that time comes for me,
my dream will become a reality.

The Fusion of Extremes
Karbala is a fusion of extremes.


There is Husain,

There are women, children,

There is supreme loyalty,
and there is extreme revenge.
There is extreme thirst,
and there is the overflowing Furat.


There is heaven,
and there is hell.


Husain is slaughtered.
Yazid’s army appears to have won.
Yet the name of Husain
reverberates to the skies,
and Yazid
burns in the belly of the earth.

The Last Debt
It is late in the day of Ashura.
The loyal seventy-two have given their lives for truth.
The sons, the brother, the men of the family of Husain
are slain and strewn
upon the hot sands of Karbala.


Husain is alone,
fighting with the strength of Haidar.


But the last debt is yet to be paid —
and Husain sheaths his sword
for the will of Allah.

Without You
Tears — where do they come from?
From the thoughts,
from the eyes,
from the heart,
from the blood ?
I don’t know.


Don’t you pity my tears that flow?
Don’t you pity the pain that strikes my heart?
Don’t you pity the emptiness that engulfs my being?
Don’t you pity the despair that fills my soul?


Yes — you do pity,
yes — you do see,
yes — you do feel,
yes — you do know.


But where do I go from here?
You taught me to live — but not without you.
You taught me to love — but not without you.
You taught me to feel — but not without you.


Why did you not teach me how to live without you?

How Shall I Go On

There is a void that cannot be filled.
There is an emptiness that cannot be filled.
There is a longing that cannot be filled.
There is a future that cannot be filled.


While the tears run down my cheeks,
while my heart is shattered in a thousand pieces,
while pain infuses my whole being —


death is inevitable.
Death comes to everyone.


Bow to the angel of death.
Bow to the destined.


That is what my mind tells me.
That is what my reason tells me.
That is what my sanity tells me.


With you, I could battle any calamity.
With you, I could climb any mountain.
With you, I could brave any storm.
With you, I could face any problem.


Now I am alone.
How shall I face the calamity?

Help me.

Who will be beside me when I stumble?
Who will guide me when I take a wrong turn?
Who will encourage me when I need courage?

Help me, support me, answer me

The Mind and the Heart
The mind is reasonable.
Accept destiny.
Life is about death.
Creation is about death.
Every living thing is subject to death.
That is reasonable, that is sane, that is logical.


But the heart sings a different tune.
It laments, it cries, it refuses to accept.


My beloved will walk through the door,
he will be here any moment,
he will call out my name.

My mind says he is with the Imam.
My heart says he is not with me.
My mind says he is drinking from the fountain of Kausar.
My heart says he is not with me.
My mind says he is looking down at us,
remembering us more than we do him.
My heart says I want him here with me.


Is it selfish on my part?
Am I only thinking of myself?


You see,
he saturated my world,
and in his absence
I am left
in a void.


________________


You Are Not Seen
Please come back to me.
There is a hollow inside me,
a vacuum within me,

without ground beneath my feet.


You have given me such wonderful children,
each one a gem,
but I want you with me, my beloved.


I sit here alone,
my heart full of you,
my thoughts, my mind, full of you.


But alas —
you are not seen.

The Essence of a Tear
A tear is not just water from the eyes —
it is a sum of passion,
grief,
love,
and longing,
that flows from the heart.

From the Ashes of Karbala
The sun lost its gleam,
the moon lost its glow,
the stars lost their sparkle.
tears flowed from the throne of Allah —
Husain has been slain in Karbala.

Then there rises a cry
from the ashes of Karbala —
Husain, Husain, Husain, Husain —
reverberating
around the world.

O man, O woman,

and see the marvellous complexity and harmony,


remember
the singularity

I Am Grateful
I am grateful
to my parents, who gave me life,
and drowned me in love,
so I could swim
against the vicissitudes of life.


I am grateful to my husband
for holding my hand
in tremors that shook my core.


For giving me children,
the pride of my life,
the pillars upon whom I rest.


And I will be grateful
when I draw my last breath,
when I am in heaven,
with Maula Khuzaima,
at the feet of Ali.

Lead Me to Heaven
I was drowning,

I was going astray,

I was sad,

I was confused,
and you showed me the way.


I was in the dark,
and you showed me the light.


Now that I am alone,
stay by my side,
and lead me to heaven.

The Path to Heaven
Allah has created man
with a brain to think

One road leads to heaven,
one path leads to hell.


O Mumin, rest assured
you are surely
on the right path,
the path to heaven.




________________


The Final Message
The Angel Jibreel is sent with a message from Allah:
Recite, O Mohammed —
there is no God but Allah,
and Mohammed is Allah’s Messenger.


The hills of Mecca,
the skies above,
the trees, the mountains,
reverberated with this message.


Till the final message in Ghadeer:
Now rise, O Mohammed —
your work is done.
Ali is now the Maula.
The seven heavens await you.
Allah awaits you.

To Reach Heaven
Man can climb 
the highest mountain,
he can plumb 
the deepest ocean.
But he must bow
in prostration
to reach heaven.
________________


The Two Paths
The descent to hell
is easy and smooth.
The climb to heaven
is arduous and long.


O Mumin —
do you wish to be
on the swift and easy path,
or the long and arduous one?


________________


The Colour Green
The colour green, after the sky’s blue,
is the most pervasive in all the world.
The green of the trees,
the green of the grass,
fills the earth with wonder.


Like Islam,
below the blue of the heavens,
it gives shade to the weary,
it gives succour to the hungry and the thirsty,
it gives refuge to the lost,
it gives hope to the disillusioned.


So come, O weary one,
come, O lost one,
come to the green of the earth —
you will have water to quench your thirst,
you will find purpose in your endless quest.


You will find heaven in your destiny.

________________
The Gates of Heaven
Man lights a fire,
the flames rise up,
but they cannot reach heaven.


Man flies high in the skies,
but he cannot reach heaven.


There is but one magic formula
that will open the gates of heaven for you:


“La Ilaha illa -llah,

Ali Wali Allah.”

What Is Death
What is death, after breathing stops?
It is a passage to the unknown.


For a Mumin
it is an awakening into Jannat.
For an ingrate
it is the beginning of punishment.


For a Mumin
it is an abode of peace.
For an ingrate
it is a burning in hell.


So, O Mumin,
do not be afraid.
You will be at the feet
of Mohammed, Ali, Fatema, Hasan, and Husain.


You will be in heaven.
What more can you ask for?

Then dark clouds gather,
the gloom deepens.
And when the earth is most desperate,
there is a burst of lightning,
a roll of thunder,
and then
the opening of Allah’s mercy.


The earth is inundated with life-giving rain —
every branch, every tree, every blade of grass
drinks thirstily,
and it is dark no more.

and woe to those who turn away.

When You Went Away
When you went away,
I was alone.
Amidst all my loved ones,
I was alone.
Amidst all the grandeur of life,
I was alone.
Amidst all the beauty of green,
I was alone.
You left—
leaving me alone.
________________


The Milk of Faith
I was born,
and given the milk of faith in my heart
through my mother,
and nourished in that same faith in my heart
by my father.


Then I grew in age,
and was blessed by Allah
with a thinking mind,
and a blessed husband.


Now the faith in my heart
and the thoughts in my mind
come together
for my passage
to heaven.
________________
You Are Everywhere
When you died,
you were raised to the highest heaven.
But I also found you
in the throbbing of my heart.
I see you in the beauty of the green,
I inhale you in the fragrance of the rose.
You are gone—
but you are everywhere.
________________
When Life Begins
Life begins at birth?
No — it begins at death.
For a Mumin,
it is everlasting bliss.
For the other,
it is a recycling back 
into stones, rocks, and trees.
________________
The Shortest Road
The shortest road
to heaven
is to say:
La ilaha illa -llah,
Mohammadun Rasulullah,
Aliyyun Waliyullah.

Spring Will Come
A poet has said:
you can destroy fields of roses,
but you cannot stop spring from coming.


So, O Yazid —
you destroyed the blooms of the house of Mohammed,
you slew Husain,


but the sun of Aale Mohammed
rose from the West
to bring spring
to the world.

If There Is Hope in Heaven
It is commonly said that life begins at birth,
but truly, it began eons ago.


It is coming together in you today 
by the spinning of the spheres,
by the light of the stars,
and we are given a chance to choose. 


Should we fritter away this precious time? 
Do we waste it in meaningless activity?
Or do we count the hours, the minutes, the seconds in prayer? 


If there is hope in heaven,
if there is horror in hell, 
the choice is clear.
My Loved Ones Are Waiting
In Allah is forgiveness.
In Mohammad is hope.
In Ali is heaven.
In Fatema is compassion.
In Hasan is continuity.
In Husain is promise.
In the Dai is the link.
What have I to fear?
My loved ones
are waiting for me.

The Ladder of Faith
Life is like a merry-go-round,
going round and round,
with all its excitement and pleasure,
round and round,
till it stops.
I want to be on a ladder of faith,
where the climb is tiring,
but the destination
is pure bliss.
________________
I Have a Prayer in my Heart
I have a prayer in my heart —
that is Ali.
I have a prayer in my being —
that is Ali.
This prayer will lead me to heaven,
where I will be
at the feet of Ali.

O Lion of Allah
O lion of Allah,
O brother of Mohammed,
O Maula Ali,
who held aloft the mighty Zulfikar,
defeated the enemies of Islam,
slew Abde-Wadd,
killed Marhab, Antar,
protected the Rasool —
why have you sheathed your sword?


And he replies —
for the defense of Islam,
it was drawn.
for the safety of Islam,
it is sheathed.

The Horror of Karbala
It is blisteringly hot.
Husain, with his party
of women and children,
his sons and brothers,
his loyal seventy-two,
have reached Karbala,
facing an army of thousands.


And then —
the tenth of Moharram dawns.


But Allah has not created the words
to describe
the horror of Karbala.

Compensation
Jibreel comes to Mohammed,
with a message from Allah.
Mohammed conveys this message,
he lifts all out of ignorance,
he unites all under the banner of Islam,
he builds a just society,
he takes mankind on the road to heaven.


He does all this —
and what does he ask in return?
Love my family.


Yet the history of Mohammed’s family
is written in revenge,
in blood,
and in agony.

Still Waiting
Are you never going to come back to me?
How can that be?
We were one — two hearts beating as one.
You were me, I was you.


It is presumptuous of me to say so,
but you made me feel at one with you.
I would do anything, say anything —
but I knew you would love me in spite of it.


Now this alienation — you far away,
and me, alone in loneliness,
waiting for you to come through the door,
waiting for your smile,
waiting for you to ask for coffee, or tea, or whatever.


Waiting.
Waiting.
Still waiting.
Biding my time —
still waiting.


Will you meet me when the waiting is over?
Will we resume our life when the waiting is over?
Will you tell me why you left so suddenly —
leaving me behind?

Man Can Endure Pain
Man can endure pain,
not the pain of Karbala.
Man can endure thirst,
not the thirst of Karbala.
Man can endure the death of a child,
not the massacre of a child
in his father’s arms in Karbala.


Man can endure suffering,
not the suffering of Karbala.
Man can endure loss,
not the loss of Karbala.


Yet — if you wish to be rid of your pain,
your thirst, your agony, your suffering, your loss —
pervade your mind with the tragedy of Karbala.


You will be cleansed
of all your pain,
all your thirst,
all your suffering,
all your loss.
You will be washed clean.
